								<h3>Included Mods -  Foli Client 1.16.x</h3>
								<p>This is not the comprehensive mod list, the full mod list and credit list can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/foliclient/FoliClientInstaller">Github</a> page.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>VoxelMap</h4>
								<p>A popular minimap and worldmap mod that provides a map in your HUD, as well as a worldmap that is automatically filled out as you explore. It also includes waypoint support. Note that the hotkey to open the worldmap has been remapped from <code>m</code> to <code>`</code> (the same key as <code>~</code> on most keyboards). In addition, Cave Mode and Radar are turned off by default as they are illegal on TG and many other SMP servers.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>InventoryHUD+</h4>
								<p>Displays the contents of your inventory, your armor status, and any potion/beacon effects in HUDs</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>MiniHUD</h4>
								<p>MiniHUD primarily displays FPS, Ping, RAM usage, and other statistics in a highly configurable HUD. In addition, it also allows you to preview the contents of shulker boxes by holding <code>shift</code> when hovering over one in yoru inventory. MiniHUD also provides an overlay that displays the light levels of the blocks around you, toggled using <code>f7</code>.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>Litematica</h4>
								<p>Allows you to make schematics of builds, and display them as an overlay in game to help recreate a build. Note that the execution hotkey is set to <code>f6</code>.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>ReplayMod</h4>
								<p>Allows you to record gameplay, and view it as if in spectator mode later. Autorecording is disabled by default, but can be enabled in settings. If you're using it on TG, remember not to abuse it to see where you shouldn't, or gain any unfair advantage. ReplayMod depends on FFmpeg to function correctly. The FFmpeg exe for Windows is included in the Foli Client installer, meaning Windows users don't need to do anything, however, if you're on a Mac or Linux machine you will need to install FFmpeg manually. For more info go to <a href="https://www.replaymod.com/">ReplayMod's Website</a>.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>DynamicFPS, Sodium/Optifine, Lithium, Phosphor</h4>
								<p>Performance enhancing mods that significantly increase the game's performance. Depending on what you choose during installation, either Sodium and Lithium or Optifine and OptiFabric will be installed. Both mods are FPS enhancers, however each have their pros and cons. Optifine is older, but has shader support and more configuration options. Meanwhile Sodium is a newer mod, and generally gets more FPS on newer computers, but has no shader support and very few options to configure.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>Ok Zoomer</h4>
								<p>Allows you to zoom by holding the <code>c</code> key. This mod is not installed if OptiFine is chosen, as OptiFine includes the same functionality.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>MyBrightness</h4>
								<p>A FullBright mod. The default key to toggle it is <code>5</code> on the numpad, however this can be changed using the ingame control settings.</p>
